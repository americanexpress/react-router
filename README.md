One App Router was forked from [react-router@3](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3) and is being uplifted to work with `react@17`.

The reason for forking `react-router@3`, rather than switching to a different router or upgrading to a newer version, is due to the coupling of `react-router@3`'s API with [One App](https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app), [Holocron](https://github.com/americanexpress/holocron) and existing One App modules.

We want to ensure that One App will be compatible with `react@17`, in its current state `react-router@3` relies on React's legacy context API, which will be removed in `react@17`, as well as legacy UNSAFE lifecycle methods.

Updating to the new context API would be considered a breaking change as `react-router` would no longer be compatible with older versions of `react@<16.3.0`. The `react-router` project has already moved to v5 therefore it is not possible to make any breaking changes to `react-router@3`.

We will evaluate moving to `react-router@6` if it matches our use case in the future.

This is not meant to be a generic standalone Routing library but one which will be tailored for use with the One ecosystem.

## ü§π‚Äç Usage

### Installation
```
$ npm install @americanexpress/one-app-router
```

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) that supports either CommonJS or ES2015 modules, use as you would anything else:

```js
// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel
import { Router, Route, Link } from '@americanexpress/one-app-router'

// not using an ES6 transpiler
var Router = require('@americanexpress/one-app-router').Router
var Route = require('@americanexpress/one-app-router').Route
var Link = require('@americanexpress/one-app-router').Link
```

### See it in action

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Router, Route, Link, browserHistory } from '@americanexpress/one-app-router';

function App() {/*...*/}
function About() {/*...*/}
function NoMatch() {/*...*/}

async function getUsersFragment() {/*...*/}
async function findUserById() {/*...*/}

function Users({ children }) {
  const [users, setUsers] = React.useState([]);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    getUsersFragment().then(setUsers);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <div className="overview">
        <ul>
          {/* use Link to route around the app */}
          {users.map(user => (
            <li key={user.id}>
              <Link to={`/user/${user.id}`}>{user.name}</Link>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="detail">
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function User({ params }) {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    findUserById(params.userId).then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return user && (
    <div>
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      {/* etc. */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Declarative route configuration (could also load this config lazily
// instead, all you really need is a single root route, you don't need to
// colocate the entire config).
render((
  <Router history={browserHistory}>
    <Route path="/" component={App}>
      <Route path="about" component={About}/>
      <Route path="users" component={Users}>
        <Route path="/user/:userId" component={User}/>
      </Route>
      <Route path="*" component={NoMatch}/>
    </Route>
  </Router>
), document.getElementById('root'))
```
